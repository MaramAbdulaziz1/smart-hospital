The system is primarily designed as a web-based platform for general hospital staff, specifically doctors and nurses, to facilitate interaction with patients. The core aim is to enable healthcare professionals to manage patient information, conduct remote consultations, and reduce the need for patients to visit the hospital in person.
While patients are also considered stakeholders of the system, the focus of the design and development process was placed on the needs of doctors and nurses. The decision was driven by the goal of reducing the administrative and operational workload for hospital staff, thereby improving efficiency within clinical workflows.
