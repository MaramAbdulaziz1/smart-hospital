# ⚠️ Project Guidelines

To ensure consistent development practices across the team, please follow the rules below:

### 📁 Structure and File Separation

- **Separate HTML and CSS**: Do not write CSS inside `<style>` tags or directly in HTML files. All styling should be placed in `.css` files (e.g. `style.css`) and linked via the `<link>` tag.

---

### 🧹 Code Formatting and Consistency

- **Install and enable the following VS Code extensions:**
  - [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
  - [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (Recommended for frontend development)

- **Enable auto-format on save**
  - Set `"editor.formatOnSave": true` in settings
  - Set Prettier as the default formatter

---

### 🧾 Coding Standards

- Use **2 spaces for indentation**
- Use **LF** as the line ending (cross-platform consistency)
- Use **UTF-8** encoding for all files
- Ensure there is **a newline at the end of every file** (handled by EditorConfig)

---

### 🔄 Git Commit Guidelines

- Write **clear commit messages** that explain the changes made
